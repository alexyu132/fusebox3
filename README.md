# fusebox3
 
The latest in the FuseBox line of 3D printers.

## Improvements:
- Pure rail CoreXY movement - Y-axis bars swapped out for MGN9 rails fixed directly to the frame
- Space efficiency - Larger 235x235x235mm build area with slightly smaller desk footprint - 348x370mm vs 390x340mm
- More stable dual leadscrew z-axis, belt driven by a single motor (avoids leadscrews getting out of sync)
- Dual 4010 blowers, mounted on either side of the hotend for better cooling performance
- Easy belt tensioning via sliding motor mounts
